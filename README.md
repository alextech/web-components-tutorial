# Web Components Tutorial Repository

These are sources for tutorials published at [Alex Tech Adventures](http://alex-tech-adventures.com) and
[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXRC3l-ZhN3oVg9Wk7A7i6Qv_BXTrntZb).
The tutorial is derived from Admin LTE template at [AdminLTE repository](https://github.com/almasaeed2010/AdminLTE). The idea is to convirt the template into reusable components without a framework, only HTML standards.

You can use issue tracker to report problems or suggestions.
